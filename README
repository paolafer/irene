         IRENE  (InteRfacE for a Next Event)              
============================================================

IRENE depends on ROOT as a 3rd-party library. Moreover, SCons is used to compile and build 
IRENE. SCons depends on Python.

So, in order to build IRENE, you need to have the following software installed:

- ROOT
- Python, version >1.5.2
- SCons (http://www.scons.org/), version >= 1.0.0 


Installation
============

scons PREFIX=/path/to/installation/folder install

If you want to build irene in the current directory, you don't need to specify the PREFIX variable.

The building creates an irene-config file in the bin directory under the installation path. Make sure you add 
/path/to/installation/folder/bin to your $PATH variable and then check your installation doing

irene-config
